🎓 Edemy – Full-Stack E-Learning Platform
Edemy is a fully functional e-learning web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a complete platform for educators to create and manage courses, and for students to browse, purchase, and learn online.

This project was built as part of my full-stack development journey and showcases key concepts like user authentication, secure payments, role-based access, and dynamic content rendering.
